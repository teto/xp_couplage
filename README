THis folder contains nearly everything necessary to reproduce the experience described in this paper ...


Here are the additional requirements:
- you will need to install a custom version of lispmob.- python3 along with several of its modules, 
-minupnpc and its python binding ( 
make pythonmodule3
sudo make installpythonmodule3)
-libnl3 and its python binding (trunk version, experimental)
 https://github.com/miniupnp/miniupnp.git
-Add the path to the isix folder to your env var PYTHONPATH

Available here:
-You will need to install python 2 and 3  and iperf and webfs.
-an ssh server running on both server
-libnl installed
-script folder should be in the PATH (transform into need to export a var in bash called $LISP_MPTCP_EXP_FOLDER (escape the $ in ssh command) )
-add the isix folder to your PYTHONPATH environment variable

You first need to properly configure the *.ini files.


Then launch setup.py

 sudo pip3 install pyro4

Pyro_server should be launched by hand.

-shoulb be able to pass graph to trace (by referencing previous tests ? or datasets ?)
- use shutil.copytree to build initramfs ?
-need an expect system to automate sudo commands
python3 -m Pyro4.naming
